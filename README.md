# consoleToy1

https://zalorcakelord.github.io/consoleToy1/

A silly little toy to run javascript code.
---

Has a few built in functions:

  - log(string)  displays a string in the output
  
  
  - scrollText(string,interval)  displays the string character by character at the given interval. Interval is in ms.
  
  
  - display(string)  adds the given string to the output without clearing it.
  
  
  - scrollLoop(string, interval, number of loops) repeats scrollText

Has a few quality of life bits, such as autoplacing a closing parenthese/bracket or similar.
The save function will compress the code in the input box and display it in output. You can then paste the compressed code into the input box and click the hourglass to decompress it. Working on a feature to run code from url.
